    <h1>First day of Fullstack</h1>
    <h2>Lessson Plan or Objectives</h2>
    <p>In the world of software programming, it helps to have someone on <br><br>the team who is something of a jack of all trades.
         They can help with various stages of development and have the<br><br> versatility and time management to assist all levels of the development team. 
         When it comes to web development, <br><br>that role belongs to the Full Stack Developer. 
         This is not a Back End or Front End developer,<br><br>but someone who handles both — a “Full Stack,” as it were.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>When Is a Full Stack Developer Needed?</h3>
        <p>
            <h4>It depends on the size and scalability of the software.<br><br>
                 For instance, a small independent game group made up of only<br><br> a few people creating a small simulator could have one 
                 Back End Developer and one Front End Developer and that<br><br> might be all they need for the development. 
                 If they’re even smaller, they might have one<br><br> Full Stack Developer who handles the entire application. 
                 On the other hand, a large web application with strong potential<br><br>for scaling will require many hands on deck
                  — Back End, Front End, and Full Stack Developers.</h4>
