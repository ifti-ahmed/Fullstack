        What exactly is a computer programmer? Computer programmers write code. They write code to design programs.<br> This may sound vague, but computer programming is a vast field with many different specializations.<br>In order to effectively include all of the database managers, web developers, systems analysts,<br>and application devs, it is easier to group them under the umbrella of “computer programmers.”

        If you love writing code, computer programming might be for you. <br>In this article we’ll discuss steps it takes to become a computer programmer.<br> We’ll break down each step in detail so you’ll have a better understanding of what the work itself will look like.<br>You may have seen some of our longer guides on finding a job<br> in the tech industry like

        Coders don’t necessarily have to be professionals to be considered computer programmers.<br>There are plenty of hobbyists out there that, according to our definition of computer programming, make the grade.<br>Even so, we’ll focus on the path to finding a computer programming career.

            To the uninitiated, computer science and software engineering describe two very similar disciplines.<br> In reality, these two fields are completely different. <br>Computer science is centered around learning general computational principles and applying them to a range of fields <br>like machine learning, database management, and information security.<br> Software engineering on the other hand is engineering oriented and revolves around the<br> practical skills necessary to design, develop, and maintain software systems.

            <P> 
                Similarly, the role of a computer programmer and a software engineer are quite different.<br>As previously mentioned, programmers typically work in a more specialized area of the development process.<br>They are responsible for writing code and building software. Software engineers are still very much involved in the development process,<br> but they are more likely to oversee broader areas as well. <br>Software engineers are often responsible for conception of an idea,troubleshooting, and implementation as well as development.

            <p>
                Coders and computer programmers occupy a unique position in the job market.<br>It is common for large high-paying organizations to not require a computer programming degree or other bespoke education requirements.<br> As long as you present the hiring team with a resume and portfolio of projects you’ve worked on,<br> and are able to pass a technical interview, many companies don’t care if you <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/how-to-become-a-programmer-with-no-degree" target="_blank">don’t have a degree.</a> 
            </p>

            <h2 id="Whatkind">What kind of programmer do you want to be?</h2>
            <img src="https://www.educative.io/api/page/6476200228945920/image/download/6657692645195776" height="90" width="100">
            
            <p>
                There are so many different flavors of programming that if you love to code,<br> it may be daunting to determine what you want to pursue as a career.<br> The best way to find out what you like to try as much as you can.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just a few types of programmer jobs to look into are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Software application development</li>

                    <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/beginner-guide-to-web-dev" target="_blank">Web development</a></li>

                    <li>Front end, back-end, and full-stack</li>

                    <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/exploring-data-science-with-microsofts-applied-ai-engineer" target="_blank">Data Science</a>
                    and <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/machine-learning-for-data-science" target="_blank">machine learning</a></li>
                    
                    <li><a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/database-design-tutorial">Database administrator</a></li>

                    <li>System design</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                Each of these disciplines require slightly different skills. Seek out as much as you can with respect to all the different fields,<br>and remember that nothing is set in stone. If, in your education, you find that web development is not what you find interesting<br>and would prefer to spend your time training artificial intelligence and studying <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/neural-networks-python">neural networks</a>,<br> allow yourself the the time to pivot. The world of computer programming is so diverse that it can be hard to find a niche,<br>but it is very rewarding once you settle.

            <h2 id="here3">Is it hard to become a programmer?</h2>

            <p>The short answer is: no, but it does take a fair bit of work.<br> The path to getting a coveted, high paying programming job is a long one, but one everyone is capable of. <br>Stay tuned, and we’ll walk you through all the steps to employment in detail!</p>

            <p>Oftentimes, the idea of a coder or a programmer is thought of as an impenetrable role.<br> One that is impossible to access if you didn’t grow up as a math prodigy.<br> While a strong background in math may expedite the path to becoming a programmer, it is by no means a firm pre-requisite.<br> When examining what people associate with computer science or programming, it is easy to see why it’s lauded as difficult and insulated.<br>If you asked the lay person to explain how YouTube, Google, or Facebook work, most would have a very rough idea, or none at all.</p>

            <p>It is not hard to think like a computer, but it does require some adjustment.<br> This article: <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/think-like-a-programmer">How to think like a programmer </a>is a great jumping off point if you feel unsure<br> about your ability to jump into the weeds of programming languages and computer science.</p>
